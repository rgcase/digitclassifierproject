            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
            This is a classifier for numerical digits 0-9 that was completed as a project 
            for CISC 859 at Queen's University.
            </p>
            <p>
            Image files are accepted in .bmp format for both training and classification,
            and are dealt with using the Pillow[1] library.
            </p>
            <p>
            Classification methods include a naive implementation of k-nearest neighbours,
            and multiple other methods that are available in the scikit-learn[2] library.
            </p>
            <p>
            The accuracy of the classifier is not really acceptable for any real use but 
            it does a better job than random guessing. The framework is here though, so 
            it could be improved by doing better feature selection and tweaking the 
            classifiers that are used.
            </p>
            <p>
            The source code (along with this website) are hosted on github. You can find it
            <a href="http://github.com/rgcase/digitclassifierproject">here</a>.

            <h1>Feature Extraction</h1>
            <p>
            The examples I used for both the training and test data were obtained from
            the CISC 859 course website. These images can be found 
            <a href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/cisc859/download/859.digits/bmp.images.patrice/">
            here</a>. The images used for training were the files prefixed by "trg" and 
            the test images were the files prefixed by "test".
            </p>
            <p>
            The first phase of extracting features is to extract the digits themselves
            from the .bmp images. This happens in <a href="https://github.com/rgcase/digitclassifierproject/blob/master/partitionimages.py">
            partitionimages.py</a>. Each image file is opened and loaded as an Image 
            object using Pillow.
            </p>
