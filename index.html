            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
            This is a classifier for numerical digits 0-9 that was completed as a project 
            for CISC 859 at Queen's University.
            </p>
            <p>
            Image files are accepted in .bmp format for both training and classification,
            and are dealt with using the Pillow library.
            </p>
            <p>
            Classification methods include a naive implementation of k-nearest neighbours,
            and multiple other methods that are available in the scikit-learn library.
            </p>
            <p>
            The accuracy of the classifier is not really acceptable for any real use but 
            it does a better job than random guessing. The framework is here though, so 
            it could be improved by doing better feature selection and tweaking the 
            classifiers that are used.
            </p>
